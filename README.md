# Principal-Component-Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimension-reduction tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables to a small set 
that still contains most of the information in the large set.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of (possibly) correlated variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components
 
 The first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible.
 
Traditionally, principal component analysis is performed on a square symmetric matrix.
